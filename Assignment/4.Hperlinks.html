        <p>When the night has come
          And the land is dark
          And the moon is the only light we'll see
          No, I won't be afraid
          Oh, I won't be afraid
          Just as long as you stand
          Stand by me
          
          So, darling, darling
          Stand by me, oh, stand by me
          Oh, stand, stand by me

"The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue across the tranquil lake. The gentle ripples on the water's surface mirrored the fading light, creating a mesmerizing dance of reflections. Birds returned to their nests, and the evening air was filled with the soothing symphony of crickets. It was a moment of serene beauty, a pause in the rush of life, where time seemed to stand still, and nature whispered its secrets to those willing to listen."</p>
